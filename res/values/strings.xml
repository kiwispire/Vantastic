There are several alternatives availabe: \n \n * The Wellington Airport Flyer Bus runs every 15 minutes and costs $8.50 one-trip.  It has leather seats, air-conditioning and free wi-fi.  You can find it just outside the baggage area, to the right. \n \n \n * Take a taxi (preferably sharing with other Telecom folk) using one of our preferred suppliers (refer to the intranet).</string>
